# The Downfall of the Yellow Cab
 
## Introduction

With the rise in prevalency in private rideshring services, I wanted to see how the yellow cab industry was performing aganist the likes of Uber and Lyft. I also wanted to analyze just how much the pandemic affected the ridesharing industry. What I found is that yellow cabs lost the majority of their marketshare in just a few short years. In addition, in 2022, Uber & Lyft have essentially recovered their pre-pandemic numbers while Yellow Cabs have not had a sucessful recovery.

## The Project

The yellow taxi has been around since the 1920's and are an integral form of transportation. Since Uber/Lyft started to make a dent in the market (at least in NY) in 2015, taxi patronage started to drastically decrease. 

In 2016, Uber/Lyft made up 33% of all the rides in NYC. THis number from here on out will only get higher.

In 2018, Uber/Lyft surpassed the Yellow Cabs by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

In 2020, the pandemic began and both Uber/Lyft and Yellow Cabs essentially experinced a rideshare crash. However, Uber/Lyft still withheld the majorty of the marketshare.

In 2021, Uber/Lyft soared making up more than 70% of the rides in NYC. Yellow Cabs only made up 14% of the total rides leaving them no where close back to their prepandemic levels.

But the question is why is this happening? 

One major contributing factor is simply the cost. On average it is cheaper to take an Uber/Lyft if you live anywhere besides Manhattan. If you live in Manhattan however, it is slightly cheaper to take a Yellow Cab. Please do take into consideration where it is you traveling to as these fares will vary. Overall, the cost of a trip is fairly consistant around the board for Uber/Lyft. Yellow Cab fares vary as it is not a set price and could become volitie based on traffic congestion, congestioin charges (if your trip goes below 96st in Manhattan), and other factors.

There is hope for these iconic NY Yellow Cabs. Uber will include Yellow Cabs in their app. Under the Uber banner, there may be less compitiion between services. On the othere side, a NYC cab union wants a wage increase for it's drivers. Should this go through, taxi fares at a minimum, will increase our ride fares by $2 dollars. It's a tricky situation because of rising gas prices, inflation, and the cost of maintaining these cabs.
