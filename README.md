# The Downfall of the Yellow Cab
 
## Introduction

With the rise in prevalency in private rideshring services, I wanted to see how the yellow cab industry was performing aganist the likes of Uber and Lyft. I also wanted to analyze just how much the pandemic affected the ridesharing industry. What I found is that yellow cabs lost the majority of their marketshare in just a few short years. In addition, in 2022, Uber & Lyft have essentially recovered their pre-pandemic numbers while Yellow Cabs have not had a sucessful recovery.
